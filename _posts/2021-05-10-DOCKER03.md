# Linux distributions (Linux distros)

Linux is an open-source: There's lot of variations according to their usage

- Ubuntu
- Debian
- Alpine
- Fedora
- CentOS

## Install ubuntu

Shortcut: ``` $ docker pull ubuntu ``` &rightarrow; ``` $ docker run ubuntu```

> ```run``` automatically download and run image if not already downloaded from docker hub.

```$ docker ps``` shows only running containers, while ```$ docker ps -a``` shows stopped containers as well.

## Start a container and iteract with it

```$ docker run -it ubuntu``` opens a shell

root@ccbf220836a0:/#<br>
root: user id <br>
ccbf220836a0: machine id <br>
/: current directory <br>
#: Show highest privileges in linux since we logged in as a root<br>

``` bash
root@ccbf220836a0:/# echo hello
hello
root@ccbf220836a0:/# whoami
root
root@ccbf220836a0:/# echo $0
/bin/bash  # Show location of the shell program
root@ccbf220836a0:/#
```

Linux is case-sensitive system &rightarrow; ```Echo $0``` will not work

# Managing packages

Package managers

- npm
- yarn
- pip
- NuGet
- apt (advanced package tool)

May have tones of packages in this database, but not all of them are installed.

```
# apt install vim
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package vim
```

```# apt list``` to see all the packages

```# apt update``` to update package DB (__Before installing package, always update package DB__)

```# apt -y install vim``` to install vim from updated package DB. (-y to yes to confirmation)

# Linux file system

Hierarchical system
- /
  - bin # binaries and programs
  - boot # everything needed for booting
  - dev # devices
  - etc # editable text configuration
  - home # Multiple users have home directory here
  - root # Home directory of root user
  - lib # Library fiels like s/w lib. dependencies
  - var # variable (files that needed to be updated frequently like log, application data)
  - proc # running processes

&rightarrow; In Linux, everything is a file including directories, devices, processes.
