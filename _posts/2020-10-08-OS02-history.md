## 1950s

* ENIAC: First computer
    - No OS
    - App controls resources

## Early 1960s

* Increasing users and programs
    - First OS using **Batch Processing System**
        + Execute program in consecutive order
    - Cons of batch processing system
        + Long response time (if slow program run first)
        + Long execution time (App can occupy CPU when it does not need it)

## Late 1960s

* New systems proposed - Not yet implemented in OS
    - Time Sharing System - Divide CPU usage time
        + Support multi user
        + Minimize computer response time

    - Multi Tasking
        + Creating an illusion of simultaneous program execution to user **in single CPU** (like a flip book)
        + Usually multi tasking = time sharing system

    - Multi Programming
        + Maximize CPU Utility (CPU usage per time)

* Summary
    - Divide time to execute multiple program
        + Shorter response time (_Time sharing system_, support multi user)
        + Shorter execution time (_Multi programming_)
        + User feels multiple program runs simultaneously (_Multi tasking_)

## 1970s

* UNIX OS: Actual OS came out
    - C Language by Dennis Ritchie
    - Multitasking, Time sharing system, Multiprogramming
    - Single computer used by multiple users

* Why need C language?
    - Assembly language was used to develop S/W before 1970
        + Every computer needed to be re-programmed due to each computer's different H/W (CPU, Memory,...)
        + High complexity in programming
    - C language in 1970s
        + Compiler: no need for re-programming
        + Low complexity in programming

## 1980s

* Personal Computer (PC)
    - Don't need to share single computer

* UI
    - CLI: Keyboard (until early 1980)
    - GUI: Mouse (mid 1980)

## 1990s

* Era of application program by GUI environment
    - Excel, PPT, etc
    - Popularization of Windows

* Network technology
    - Popularization of www internet

* Open source campaigne (open and free for everyone)
    - Linux OS

## after 2000

* Vitalization of open source
    - Linux
    - Apache
    - MySQL
    - Android
    - Deep Learning
    - IoT 
    ...

* Virtual machine
    - Single CPU runs multiple OS

* Massive parallel computing
