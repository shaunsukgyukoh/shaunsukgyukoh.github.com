## Role of OS

1. System Resource Manager
    * System Resource = Computer H/W
        - CPU, Memory (DRAM, RAM), I/O devices (keyboard, mouse, network, monitor), storage (SSD, HDD)
    * H/W cannot do anything by itself.
        - CPU cannot decide how much to use
        - Memory cannot decide which address and how much should be assigned for each program
        - Keyboard, mouse cannot indicate itself

2. Support user - computer communication

3. Control and manage computer H/W and Application program
    * Process management
    * Main memory management
    * File management
    * Disk management
    * I/O management
    * Networking
    * Security

## Application program

* Program = S/W = OS + Application (App)
* OS manages Apps
    - Execution
    - Permission
    - User (login)
* Why OS need to manage apps? -> Apps can be made by anyone
    - Abnormality may occur
        + Inf loop
        + Program down
        + Unwanted file deletion (managing permisison / user)
        + Using all resources by app itself

> **Goal of OS:** To support App to work efficiently and appropriately by assiging resource efficiently 

## Where is OS?

* Installed in storage(HDD/SSD)
* OS goes to memory when it boots up
* von Neumann Architecture
