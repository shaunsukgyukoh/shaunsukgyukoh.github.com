# Install Docker

Follow guides in https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

> Windows: Must enable __Hyper-V__ and __Containers__ Windows features via
>
> 1. Right click on the Windows button and select 'Apps and Features'
> 2. Select Programs and Features on the right under related settings.
> 3. Select Turn Windows Features on or off.
> 4. Select Hyper-V and Containers (WSL if needed)
> 5. Click OK.

- Check docker version

```bash
$ docker version
```

# Development workflow using Docker

1. Take application and dockerize it (Make small change so that it can be run by docker) &rightarrow; Add __Dockerfile__ to it.

  > Dockerfile is a plain text file that includes instructions that docker uses to package up this application into an image. This image contains everything our application needs to run everything such as,
  >
  > - A cut-down OS
  > - A runtime environment (eg Node, MongoDB, Python, etc.)
  > - Application files
  > - 3rd party libraries
  > - Environment variables

2. Once we have an image, we tell docker to start a container using that image w/ command: ```$ docker run ...```

3. Once we have this image, we can push it to a docker registry like docker hub (A storage for docker images that anyone can use)

> _docker hub - docker_ is like _github - git_

4. Then, we can put it on any machines running docker so that it can have same images w/ development machine which containes a specific version of applications and everything it needs it.

# Docker in action

``` bash
$ mkdir hello-docker # create directory
$ cd hello-docker # move into directory
$ code. # run vs code for editor
```

- Create a new file _app.js_

  ``` javascript
  console.log("Hello Docker!");
  ```

  Instructions for deploying this program
  - Start w/ an OS
  - Install Node (an execution environment for javascript code)
  - Copy app files
  - Run ```$ node app.js```

    __&rightarrow;__ Write instructions in __Dockerfile__

- Create _Dockerfile_ (Don't need extension)

``` Docker
FROM node:alpine # Base image (act like inheritance)
COPY . /app # Copy everything in current dir. to new dir. called /app (create dir if not present)
CMD node /app/app.js # execute command
```
``` Docker
COPY . /app
# If you don't want the prefix for CMD
WORKDIR /app
CMD node app.js
```

> Base images are built and can be found in docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/
> Can specify a tag using colon (:)

- Build

``` bash
$ docker build -t hd . # -t tag, . is where docker can find _Dockerfile_
```

- Check built image

``` bash
$ docker image ls
```

- Run docker image

``` bash
$ docker run hd
```

- Testing docker images in docker hub in https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

  - alt + enter to full-screen
  - ```$ docker pull [name]```
  - ```$ docker image ls```
  - ```$ docker run [name] ```
